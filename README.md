Discretization: The domain is discretized into a grid of control volumes. The governing equations, i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations and the energy equation, are discretized using a finite volume formulation.

Initialization: The initial values for the flow variables, such as velocity, pressure, and temperature, are assigned to each control volume.

Boundary Conditions: Appropriate boundary conditions are specified for each boundary of the domain. For a heated channel flow, typical boundary conditions include specifying the inlet velocity and temperature, the wall temperatures, and the pressure at the outlet.

Solution of Equations: The discretized equations are solved using a numerical algorithm. One of the most common algorithms used in FVM is the SIMPLE algorithm (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations). The SIMPLE algorithm involves solving the momentum equation to obtain a tentative velocity field, followed by the solution of the pressure correction equation to obtain the pressure correction field. The velocity field is then corrected using the pressure correction, and the process is repeated until convergence is achieved.

Iteration and Convergence: The solution process is iterated until convergence is achieved. Convergence is typically achieved when the residuals, i.e., the difference between the current and previous solutions, fall below a specified tolerance.

Post-processing: The final solution is post-processed to obtain the desired quantities, such as the velocity profile, pressure distribution, and temperature distribution.

When implementing the SIMPLE algorithm, it is important to ensure that the discretization scheme used for the momentum and energy equations is consistent and stable. Common schemes include the central difference scheme, the upwind scheme, and the QUICK scheme. Additionally, the time-step size and grid resolution must be chosen appropriately to ensure accuracy and stability.

Overall, the simulation of a laminar heated channel flow using FVM and the SIMPLE algorithm involves discretizing the domain, specifying boundary conditions, solving the discretized equations using the algorithm, and post-processing the results. Proper implementation of the algorithm and careful selection of the numerical parameters are crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable results.
